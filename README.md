# DFRobot_TCS3430

Adding the micropython esp32 library and example. Many thanks to yangfeng for the original raspberry pi code at https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_TCS3430


The device features advanced digital Ambient Light Sensing (ALS) and CIE 1931 Tristimulus Color Sensing (XYZ). Each of the channels has a filter to control its optical response, which allows the device to accurately measure ambient light and sense color. These measurements are used to calculate chromaticity, illuminance and color temperature, all of which are used to support various potential applications.
